## Getting Started

#### Controls

- Start button
- Up, Down, Left and Right arrows to control moment
- Mute button to stop music  .

#### Objectives

- Frogger is a game where you guide a frog from the bottom of the screen to the top while avoiding obstacles on the way.  

- For my game, each time a frog reaches home, the speed of the obstacles increases a little. 

- You have three lives to get the highest score you can. Each time you collide with an obstacle or an obstacle collides with you you lose one life. Lose all three lives and its game over.

- You get 10 points by moving the frog either up, left or right. Moving backward will cost you 5 points. You get bonus points for advancing to the next level, the higher the level the more bonus points you'll recieve.  

## Bugs/ Missing features

- High Score function using localStorage was not implmented in time
- Restarting the game causes previous existing obstacles to be carried over to the next game making the game significantly more difficult. This cannot be resolved without refreshing browser.

## Development Reflections

Overall the build process was intresting and fun even when I had some bugs in the game. I orignally planned to have selectable grid sizes to give users a difficulty option but due to time constraints I was unable to implement that feature.
